## Installation

To install use pip:

```bash
xpip install xontrib-whole-word-jumping
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com/xonsh/xontrib-whole-word-jumping
```

## Usage

```bash
xontrib load whole_word_jumping
```

* `Control+left/right`: Jump to previous/next whole word
* `Control+backspace`: Delete to beginning of whole word
* `Control+delete`: Delete to end of whole word
* `Shift+delete`: Delete whole word

Alt+Left/Right/Delete/Backspace remain unmodified:

* `Alt+left/right`: Jump to previous/next token
* `Alt+backspace`: Delete to beginning of token
* `Alt+delete`: Delete to end of token

## Known issues

Some terminals cannot differentiate between Backspace and Control+Backspace.
In this case, users can set `$XONSH_WHOLE_WORD_CTRL_BKSP = False` to skip
configuration of the Control+Backspace key binding.
